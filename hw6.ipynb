Parameter changes led to different groupings, which showed how sensitive unsupervised methods can be to hyperparameter optimization and representations!"

    "## Exercise 3: Clustering recipe names\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll cluster recipe names with some of the clustering algorithms we have seen in class. This will also involve making some attempts to pick reasonable hyperparameter values for each clustering method based on the quality of the resulting clusters. For example, for KMeans, you need to specify the number of clusters in advance, which is often challenging on real-world datasets. For DBSCAN, you need to pick appropriate `eps` and `min_samples`. For hierarchical clustering, you need to pick a suitable linkage criterion, distance metric, and prune the tree so that it's possible to visualize and interpret it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some methods which may help you with picking reasonable values for the hyperparameters. \n",
    "- Visualize the Elbow plot (KMeans). \n",
    "- Visualize Silhouette plots. \n",
    "- Visualize resulting clusters using `plot_umap_clusters` function from Exercise 1. \n",
    "- Sample some recipes from each cluster, manually inspect whether there are coherent semantic themes. (For this, you may use the function `print_clusters` given below.) \n",
    "        \n",
    "> You may use the [`yellowbrick`](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/) package for visualizing the Elbow plot and the Silhouette plots. You can intall it with\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install -c districtdatalabs yellowbrick```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the process of picking reasonable hyperparameter values will be exploratory, iterative, and will involve manual inspection and judgment, as there is no ground truth to verify how well the model is doing. In your solutions, please do not include everything you try. Only present the results of the most informative trials. Add a narrative to your answer so that it's easy for the grader to follow your choices and reasoning.** "
